    "**Summary [Salvador Robles]**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this process, we have performed the **Data Wrangling step** of the Data Science method.In big lines, we have\n",
    "* (i) defined the *foundational questions* that we will be answering in the project,\n",
    "* (ii) analyzed the *structure, size and characteristics* of the raw data, and\n",
    "* (iii) modified the raw data to *better understand and organize the dataset*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we have\n",
    "* a) explored the data,\n",
    "  * our resort - Montana Resort, all it's columns are populated.\n",
    "  * nº of missing values per column - We have calculated the nº and percentage of missing rows per column. Note: Pending to check how to drop/fill/leave the values.\n",
    "  * categorical features - We have better understood the relationship between Region and state in the dataset. Region is smaller than state. Also, there are no duplicated values in the dataset.\n",
    "  * numeric features - We have checked the distribution of values of numeric variables and dropped some outliers.\n",
    "* b) derived some statistics from it,\n",
    "  * We have calculated state-wise statistics of market segment. In particular, for variables 'TerrainParks', 'SkiableTerrain_ac', 'daysOpenLastYear' and 'NightSkiing_ac'.\n",
    "* c) dropped certain rows (based on our initial findings), and\n",
    "  * Droped rows with no price data at all, in total 14% of the resorts had no price data.\n",
    "* d) defined the target feature for our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of the work performed on the raw data, we have generated a **cleaned dataset**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the upcoming lines, we summarize the steps that we have followed to reach the cleaned dataset, some issues that we have encountered, and how the size of the dataset have changed through the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.3 Imports\n",
    "* We imported the necessary libraries for this step:\n",
    "    * **pandas:** *to operate with data frames*\n",
    "    * **matplotlib.pyplot:** *to plot data*\n",
    "    * **seaborn:** *to visualize data*\n",
    "    * **os:** *to interact with the operating system*\n",
    "***\n",
    "## 2.4 Objectives\n",
    "* The following questions define the fundamental topics that we are seeking to understand from the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Do you think you may have the data you need to tackle the desired question?** After our analysis, it is reasonable to state, (without considering the missing values yet), that we have sufficient data to build a model that explains the price of chairlift tickets.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Have you identified the required target value?** The target value is **price of week and weekend chairlifts**.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * **Do you have potentially useful features?** We have several potentially useful features, such as **geographical data** (Region and state of each Resort), **structural data** (nº of acres of skiable area, average snowfall,...), and **operative data** (nº of chairlift chairs, acres of snowmaking,...). Having different types of data sets good foundations for further analyses and interrelations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* **Do you have any fundamental issues with the data?** The main issue we have encountered is that we have many columns with a high percentage of missing values. In particular, there are 2 columns with close to 50% of missing values, and a second group of columns with missing values of around 15%. About half of the columns have no missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "## 2.5 Load the Data\n",
    "**Loaded the data:** from local repository, csv file\n",
    "* .info() - shows columns names, non-null value counts and datatypes of each column.\n",
    "  * **result:** - raw data size = 330 rows * 27 columns. // non null = there are missing values // dtypes = 3 object - 11 integer // 13 float\n",
    "* .head() - check how the raw data looks like.\n",
    "  * **result** - columns look good, we can already see some NaN on the observations.\n",
    "***\n",
    "## 2.6 Explore the data\n",
    "In this step, we have analyzed topics such as:\n",
    "* (i) our resort data - does our client's resort have all the information populated?\n",
    "* (ii) nº of missing values by column - initial analysis of columns with missing values\n",
    "* (iii) categorical features - understand relationship between state/Region. Leading to calculate the avg weekend and weekday price per state.\n",
    "* (iv) numeric features - analysis of distribution leading to cleaning of outliers.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 2.6.1 Find Resort of Interest\n",
    "We have filtered our resort and transpose the data to check it's values.\n",
    "* **Why?:** To check missing values, other issues with data, anticipate problems.\n",
    "* **result:** There are no missing values, we can proceed with the other observations of dataset.\n",
    "***\n",
    "### 2.6.2 Nº of missing values by column\n",
    "We have performed an analysis of the nº of observations missing on each column as well as their %. **why?** to have an preliminar idea of how many missing datapoints we have for each feature. **result** there are 13 columns with missing values:\n",
    "\n",
    "Percentages of missing values per column:\n",
    "fastEight 50.30% \n",
    "NightSkiing_ac 43.33% \n",
    "AdultWeekday 16.36% \n",
    "AdultWeekend 15.45% \n",
    "daysOpenLastYear 15.45% \n",
    "TerrainParks 15.45% \n",
    "projectedDaysOpen 14.24% \n",
    "Snow Making_ac 13.93% \n",
    "averageSnowfall 4.24% \n",
    "LongestRun_mi 1.51% \n",
    "Runs 1.21% \n",
    "SkiableTerrain_ac 0.90% \n",
    "yearsOpen 0.30% \n",
    "\n",
    "The method used, involving isnull() does not compute null values derived from outliers in the data. Therefore, there could be more missing values than the percentages included here. To find those outliers, a DataDictionary and/or focused searching must be considered.\n",
    "***\n",
    "### 2.6.3 Categorical features\n",
    "We have analyzed the categorical features of the dataset ('Name', 'Region' and 'state') to undertand the relationships between them, as apparently, 'Region' and 'State' are definitions of geographical territory. Later on in the analysis, it will be useful to understand how are they related with eachother (e.g.is state within a Region, or viceversa).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Are there duplicated values in the dataset?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Filtering of the dataset by dtypes object shows that Region and State are the same on head and tail. We wanted to contrast this hypothesis for all dataset. **how**To do so, we proceeded to **count on filtered unique values on Name**. It showed that Crystal Mountain Name appears 2 times. To further contrast the hypothesis, we **concatenate Name and Region**, it didn't give duplicate results. We did the same with **Name and state**, it didn't give duplicates. **result** there are no duplicate values in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We filtered on dataset by Name 'Crystal Mountain' to check the observations and confirm that the Region and state is different. **result** We confirm that they have different Region and state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What's the relationship between Region and State?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to know if state is within a Region, if a Region is within a state, how many times the Region and the state are equal or different. If we can understand their relationship, this will provide guidance on future criteria regarding how to approach the problem.\n",
